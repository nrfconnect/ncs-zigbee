   Zigbee certification levels

Certification levels
********************

The certification is based on CSA's `Zigbee certification policy`_, which distinguishes the following levels of certification:

* Compliant Platform
* Certified Product

The certification guarantees that a platform or product will work and will interoperate with other compliant platforms or certified products, respectively.

Nordic Semiconductor provides the Zigbee Compliant Platform.
You can use this platform as the building block for your Zigbee Certified Product, which is conformant with the ZCL and BDB standard.
