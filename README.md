# Zigbee R23 Add-on for nRF Connect SDK (Experimental support)

> **Note**
> This is an initial and [experimental](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/nrf/releases_and_maturity/software_maturity.html) release of Zigbee R23 support for Nordic Semiconductorâ€™s nRF54L15 SoC. You can expect updates and enhancements in the future, including potential optimizations related to overall performance.

The Zigbee R23 add-on for the nRF Connect SDK provides support for developing Zigbee applications based on the third-party precompiled ZBOSS stack. This stack is included as the ZBOSS Zigbee stack library. In combination with the nRF Connect SDK, the Zigbee R23 add-on allows for development of low-power connected solutions.
