# This file defines a GitHub Action for detecting documentation file changes in a pull request.
#
# This action compares two commit SHAs (typically the base and head of a PR)
# and detects which `.rst` and `.md` files under the `docs/` directory were changed.
# The list of changed documentation files is output as a JSON array, which can be used by subsequent workflow jobs
# to generate targeted PR comments or drive conditional logic for documentation builds.
#
# Inputs:
#   - base_sha:  The base commit SHA for comparison (e.g., the PR target branch).
#   - head_sha:  The head commit SHA for comparison (e.g., the latest PR commit).
#
# Outputs:
#   - docs_files:  A JSON array of documentation files changed between the SHAs,
#                  suitable for further processing or comment generation.
